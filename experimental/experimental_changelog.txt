ABOUT THIS RELEASE:
This is an experimental pre-release of BetterBurnTime. It has been
briefly tested and is believed to be playable, but hasn't been
exhaustively vetted yet, and features may still be revised before
"official" release (both for bug-fixing and for design changes).

Please see the BetterBurnTime thread on the KSP forums for detailed
discussion:
